🧠 BrainSpark — Java Swing Quiz Application

BrainSpark is a desktop-based quiz management and assessment system developed using Java Swing and JDBC.

The application allows users to attempt quizzes, manage questions, review answers, and interact with a MySQL database through an intuitive graphical interface.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Event-Driven Programming

GUI Development using Swing

Database Connectivity using JDBC

Modular Java Application Design

⚙️ Setup Instructions

1️⃣ Clone Repository

git clone https://github.com/muhd-sinan-m/BrainSpark.git
cd BrainSpark


---

2️⃣ Setup Database

Create database:

CREATE DATABASE mcq_quiz_system;
USE mcq_quiz_system;

Import SQL file:

SOURCE database.sql;


---

📦 Requirements

Java JDK 17+

MySQL Server

MySQL Connector/J (JDBC Driver)


JDBC driver included in:

lib/mysql-connector-j.jar


---

🛠 Compile the Project

✅ Windows

javac -cp "lib/mysql-connector-j.jar;src" src/*.java

✅ Linux / macOS

javac -cp "lib/mysql-connector-j.jar:src" src/*.java


---

▶️ Run the Application

Windows

java -cp "lib/mysql-connector-j.jar;src" MainMenu

Linux / macOS

java -cp "lib/mysql-connector-j.jar:src" MainMenu


---

⚠️ Important Notes

MySQL server must be running.

JDBC driver must be included in classpath.

Update database credentials in:


src/DBConnection.java

Example:

String password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";


---

🧠 Why JDBC Driver is Needed?

Java Application
        ↓
JDBC Driver (mysql-connector-j.jar)
        ↓
MySQL Database

The JDBC driver acts as a bridge allowing Java to communicate with MySQL.

🎧 Event Listeners Used

Listener	Usage

ActionListener	Button clicks & Timer events
ItemListener	Topic selection (JComboBox)
MouseListener (MouseAdapter)	Button hover styling



---

⏱ Timer Logic
